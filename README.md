# Wordle, but mean

My attempt at recreating the experience of [Evil Wordle :smiling_imp:](https://swag.github.io/evil-wordle/) as a project in Python.

Goal of the program

1. Take a random guess
2. Evaluate guess against all 5 letter words for what pattern has the most possible results
3. Inform user of how many words remain
4. Keep them guessing as long as possible

Todo:
- [X] Initial release!
- [ ] Find more complete list of words
- [ ] Add ability to give up
- [ ] Optimize guess evaluation time
- [ ] \(Optional) GUI Interface
