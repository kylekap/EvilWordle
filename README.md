# It's a lot like [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), but... evil

## What it is
My attempt at recreating the experience of [:smiling_imp: Evil Wordle :smiling_imp:](https://swag.github.io/evil-wordle/) as a project in Python.


## Goal of the program

1. Take a random guess
2. Evaluate guess against all 5 letter words for what pattern has the most possible results
3. Inform user of how many words remain
4. Keep them guessing as long as possible

## To Do
- [X] Initial release! :fireworks:
- [ ] Add ability to give up :confounded:
- [ ] Show letters guessed but not included :page_with_curl:
- [ ] Optimize guess evaluation time :hourglass:
- [ ] \(Optional) Add ability to play against other lengths of words
- [ ] \(Optional) Find more complete list of words :closed_book:
- [ ] \(Optional) GUI Interface  :computer:
